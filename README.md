This is my GitHub profile in which you can see my thoughts via code. C and C++ are home to me. Most of repositories are 
projects proposed by 42. If you have ridden my code you will guess my favourite family of OS.

If you have some good ideas, thoughts or you want to contact me, you can write me an email:
