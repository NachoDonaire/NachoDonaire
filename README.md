# Hi there 

The presence of a computer makes me feel more confortable than without it. And that's it, I do not feel weird because
if you are reading these the most probably is that you are like me but the content of the presence itself. In my case, computers
fill this dimension, and I know more than one that have the same attribute.

Music is also important to me. Although, is the most ranged language for human nature as in my opinion. Music and code are the most valuable tools I know.
This two disciplines need packages like logic, critical thinking and creativity.

My thoughts, what I desire to express of my ideas, no matter the manner, are not more relevant than any other. Main reason rests on the absence of a magnitude able to measure 
the relevance of a thought in a global, general or an absolute reference system. No bother how but as users, as a single system; we develope our own ideas relevance hierarchy and the thought 
I am going to expose by the briefest path I can, may be the top of this hierarchy or the lowest level of ideas/thoughts, as you like to contemplate it, in my own system. No need to disponse a huge mental developing or high 
number of hours on quality ideas are needed to realize there is such an impresions that governs some or all thoughts. The more subtle are this impresions, the more damage they can cause on the very most useful
tool on humanity: own, critical and deep thinking. Some fields of knowledge give us some irrevocable concepts to the human nature like Geometry or Arithmetic. But there is no such a thing that can not be subject of discussion, not even the mentioned disciplines. A single user can think that his way is the correct, other user can think its thoughts not are only correct, its thoughts are truth. When both face each other, how can they reach 
a conclusion that differs from thinking the others thoughts as stupid, irrelevant, low or just think the other ideas are over social influeced and also think the other users need a high quality
conversation with themselves? The lonely mile is not pleasant, it is not comfortable, it is needed.

If you have some good ideas, thoughts or you want to contact me, I would be so glad of reading you. Honestly, do not hesitate:
