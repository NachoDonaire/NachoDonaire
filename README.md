Hello! My name is Nacho and this is my GitHub profile ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm currently student of 42 Madrid School since 2021.

I have notions of pyhton, MySQL, bash, C++, C and more technologies and code languages.

The most valuable thing for me in this point is to keep growing up in IT world with a non stop learning method. ðŸ‘¾

I love ðŸ’™ good coffee in the morning, play the guitar, spend thime with my friends and, of course, code; a lot of code.

If you are interested in contact me ðŸ¥³ i would be so happy to talk with you. I let my contact just behind this text.
